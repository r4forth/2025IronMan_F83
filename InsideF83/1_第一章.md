# Part I   F83 系統簡介(Introduction to F83 system)

## 1. F83 的傳承(The heritage of F83)

### 1.1 F83 的根源(The roots of the F83)

Forth was invented by Charles Moore in the 60's as he developed specialized programming tools 
for various software projects and crystallized them into a language-operating system.  Forth 
spread to many continents following the radio telescopes originally programmed by Mr. Moore 
when he was with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.  Forth was so prevalent in the 
astronomy communities that the International Astronomic Union formally adopted Forth as their 
standard programming language in 1974. 

Forth 是由 Charles Moore 在 60 年代發明的，當時他為各種軟件項目開發了專門的編程工具，並將它們具體化為語言操作系統。繼摩爾先生在國家射電天文台工作時最初編程的射電望遠鏡之後，福斯傳播到許多大陸。Forth 在天文學界如此普遍，以至於國際天文學聯合會於 1974 年正式採用 Forth 作為他們的標準編程語言。

Mr. Moore and some of his colleagues left NRAO and formed the Forth, Inc. to market Forth 
systems and services in 1972. Over the years, a series of Forth implementations were produced for 
commercial minicomputers and microcomputers.  These products evolved into poly-Forth, which 
contained many advanced features such as interrupt drive I/O, multitasking-multiprogramming, 
data base management, transcendental functions, and meta- or target compilation.  It remains the 
most comprehensive Forth system in the Forth market place.

摩爾先生和他的一些同事於 1972 年離開 NRAO，成立了 Forth， Inc. 來銷售 Forth 系統和服務。多年來，為商用小型計算機和微型計算機生產了一系列 Forth 實現。這些產品演變成 poly-Forth，其中包含許多高級功能，例如中斷驅動器 I/O、多任務多編程、數據庫管理、超越函數以及元或目標編譯。它仍然是福斯市場上最全面的福斯系統。

Forth users in Europe organized a user's group, called EuropeanForth users Group (EFUG).  To 
encourage the exchange of Forth programs and information, EFUG published a list of Forth 
commands with standard commands, commonly known as the Forth-77 Standard. It documented 
the then often used Forth commands in an effort to prevent these commands from mutation as more 
Forth systems were installed. 

歐洲的 Forth 使用者組織了一個使用者群組，稱為 EuropeanForth 使用者群組 （EFUG）。為了鼓勵 Forth 程式和資訊的交換，EFUG 發布了一份帶有標準命令的 Forth 命令列表，通常稱為 Forth-77 標準。它記錄了當時經常使用的 Forth 命令，以防止這些命令隨著更多 Forth 系統的安裝而發生變化。

The Forth Interest Group was organized in 1978 to encourage the use of Forth on small personal 
computers.  Two major activities sponsored by FIG in 1978 were the publication of figForth 
Model and the organizing of the Forth Standards Team. Because of the low costs of the figForth 
source listings and the quality of these figForth implementations, figForth became the de facto 
standard of Forth on small computers.  The product from the Forth Standards Team, the Forth-78 
Standard, however, was not as successful.  It was soon orphaned by FIG.  The Forth Standards 
Team went back to the drawing board and produced the Forth-79 Standard which was much more precise in wording and consistent in the naming of standard commands.  Many vendors including 
Forth, Inc. made genuine efforts to adopt this standard into their products.  

Forth 興趣小組成立於 1978 年，旨在鼓勵在小型個人電腦上使用 Forth。1978 年，FIG 贊助的兩項主要活動是出版 figForth 模型和組織 Forth 標準小組。由於 figForth 源代碼列表的低成本和這些 figForth 實現的質量，figForth 成為 Forth 在小型計算機上的事實上的標準。然而，來自 Forth 標準團隊的產品 Forth-78 標準並沒有那麼成功。它很快就被 FIG.Forth 標準團隊重新開始製作了 Forth-79 標準，它的功能遠不止於此措辭精確，標準命令命名一致。包括 Forth， Inc. 在內的許多供應商都做出了真正的努力，將該標準採用到他們的產品中。

Several problems kept the Forth Standards Team working.  Among them, the more serious ones 
are the state dependence of many commands, the loop structure, the representation of falsehood, 
integer division with negative divisor, and the naming of many commands.  These problems were resolved in the publication of the Forth-83 Standard in early 1984.  The exhausted Forth Standards 
Team decided that no new Forth standard will be considered in the near future to let Forth-83 
Standard some time to establish itself in the Forth community.

有幾個問題使 Forth 標準團隊得以運作。其中，比較嚴重的是許多命令的狀態依賴性、循環結構、錯誤的表示、負除數的整數除法以及許多命令的命名。這些問題是循環結構在 1984 年初發布的 Forth-83 標準中得到解決。精疲力盡的 Forth 標準團隊決定在不久的將來不會考慮新的 Forth 標準，以便讓 Forth-83 Standard 有時間在 Forth 社區中站穩腳跟。

### 1.2 Advancements in Forth-83 Standard

Major improvements in Forth-83 Standards over previous Forth standards are briefly discussed here.  
Exhaustive discussions have appeared in Forth Dimensions, authored by the Secretary of the Forth 
Standards Team, Dr. Robert L. Smith.  Some of the more significant features in the Forth-83 
Standard are summarized here.

**Mono-Addressing**

Four addresses are used to address different fields in a command in the dictionary, the name field 
address, the link field address, the code field address, and the parameter field address.  To allow 
maximum implementation flexibility and code portability, the 83-Standard uses only one address, 
the compilation address.  It is equivalent to the code field address in the figForth model.  The 
compilation address is the one returned by ' and FIND, compiled to colon commands, and used by 
EXECUTE to run the command.  Only one extra command is provided in the standard to access 
information stored in the parameter field: >BODY.

The importance of the compilation address cannot be overstressed. Mono-addressing recognized 
this characteristics of Forth. It is also beneficial that the compilation address serves as the focal 
point in locating information stored in the commands. 

**Eliminating State Smart Commands**

Many Forth commands in the early standards execute differently depending upon whether the 
system is in the execution mode or compiling mode, like LITERAL, ' (tick), ." , etc.  In Forth-83 
the state smart commands are either eliminated or separate commands are defined for interpreting 
and compiling states, making the system less ambiguous and faster. 
Old ' is split into two commands: ' and ['].  Old ." is split into .( and ." .
